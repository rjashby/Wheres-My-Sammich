## Project: Where's My Sammich?

See: https://untappd.com/

### Project's Purpose or Goal: 

_This application will allow users to find, log, and review sandwiches they've eaten at different establishments._ 

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal: 

_React or React Native App._ 

1) Set up a noSQL database using MongoDB that saves places, users, and reviews.

2) Set up a front-end, backend, and api structure. 

3) Style the site to look appropriate using Tailwind CSS.

4) Log-in authorization.

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next?

1) Iâ€™d really like to make this mobile.

2) With mobility, I want users to be able to write and read reviews on the go.

3) I also want users to be able to look for the best sandwiches around them. 

### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

- React
- React Native
- MongoDB
- Next.js
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Tailwind CSS

### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

_This will be my second attempt at a proposal, so I have a good amount of work to make up._
